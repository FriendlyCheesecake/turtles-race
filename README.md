# turtles-race
Exhilarating race on blockchain... for turtles, at least.
Experimenting with blockchain technology on Unity.
Ideally a network multiplayer game.
Networking tool: Netcode for GameObjects.
Using blockchain to spice things up a bit: gambles on, mode chaos.
Blockchain tools: either Metamask SDK for Unity or Thirweb.
Constraints - contracts too expensive, next step: experiment with Ethereum Layer 2 (Base).

RULES: 
1. connect your wallet, stake to play.
2. If you reach the end, you have two options:
3. Get your stake back OR
   3.1 Change the forward key for all currents players and
4. Go to back to the beginning
5. If you arrive before everyone else who's currently player, you get your 150% of your stake back
  5.1 If you don't arrive first, you loose your stake ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
BUT Why not? What are the chances?
Good luck!
